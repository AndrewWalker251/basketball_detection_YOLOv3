**Object Detection YOLOv3**

### Intro

YOLO is a very effective approach to object detection. 

I wanted to follow though this tutorial and create an implemenation of YOLOv3 in Pytorch. https://blog.paperspace.com/tag/series-yolo/ by AYOOSH KATHURIA

I wanted to apply it to both static and video sports events and assess how well it performs. 

All instructions for getting started can be found in the original tutorial. There's also a in the tutorial to a more maintained implementation. 

I will hopefully soon have a write up on my blog.


### Results

Here are some example high level results.
